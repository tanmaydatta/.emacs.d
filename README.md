.emacs.d
========
This are my emacs configuration files. While a part of the code has been written.edited by me, major part has been taken from different sources  

### Requirements:  
* Emacs 23.3 (while some functionalities might not be available in Emacs24 and higher)  
* `color-theme` package (to install color themes)

### Installation:  
Place the files in `~/.emacs.d`, while ensuring that the `init.el` file is placed here: `~/.emacs.d/init.el`

### Key Features:
* expand region
* `C-q` for line duplication
* autocomplete
* emacs full screen mode, hiding topbars and menus (use `F11` to toggle)
